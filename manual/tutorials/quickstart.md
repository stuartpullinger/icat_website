# Quickstart

There are 2 quick ways to get an installation of the ICAT software up and running: using the BitRock installer and the Vagrant set up. Use the BitRock installer if you wish to keep, change and upgrade your installation. Use the Vagrant set up if you just want to quickly test out the software.
