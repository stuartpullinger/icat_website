Chapter 10: Log in to TopCat
============================

If you have followed all the steps in this tutorial successfully, you should have a working installation of the ICAT software loaded with test data. You may now access your TopCat installation from your web browser by visiting the following URL:

[http://localhost:8080/]

provided your system allows communication between your browser and port `8080` on your VM. If you have used the suggested Vagrant setup from this tutorial, you should have configured this in Chapter 01.
