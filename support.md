## Getting help
The first place to look to get help is our [FAQ](support/faq.md) page to see if your question has already been answered. Otherwise support for ICAT is provided through our email list. The list is hosted on Google Groups at [icatgroup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/icatgroup). The list is active and monitored by the entire ICAT development team.

## Reporting bugs
ICAT development takes place on Github under the [icatproject](https://github.com/icatproject) organisation. Each component of the ICAT software has a separate repository and issue tracker. Please use the issue tracker to report bugs. For more information, see our ["How to report a bug"](support/reporting_bugs.md) guide.
